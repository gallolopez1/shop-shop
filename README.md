## <u> Challenge instructions:</u>

Enhance an existing e-commerce platform called Shop-Shop. To do this, youâ€™ll centralize all of the application's data in state globally to make it easier to share state across the entire application. Youâ€™ll also create a shopping cart for the application, add offline functionality, and process secure online payments with a service called Stripe.
